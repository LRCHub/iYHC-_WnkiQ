Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her, the nature of my flight
As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city are extremely real
All the nightlife and the parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA
And it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her, the nature of my flight
Our golden jet is airborne
Flight 50 cuts a path across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us flight #0 is the way to fly
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea, or something stronger to start off the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby somewhere in LA
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her, the nature of my flight
Yeah, I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her, the nature of my flight
