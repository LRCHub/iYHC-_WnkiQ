Drown you out
And left you with a sound
We'll spoil good-nights
Replacing lullabies
How could they never notice
What they planted in your space
See you laughing in our picture
But I know it's out of frame
We barely cried
But she made it out alive
And I'm so proud
That you're in my hands now
If we grew up together
You will find it's not the same
I wanna jump inside that picture
Show you what you gave
If we stay long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we stay long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She'll chase us though the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we stay
I'll never let them get closer
Or shower you with any blame
Now we dance in our own picture
Where the rules have changed
If we stay long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
Say her name into the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we stay long enough
We can play with Bloody Mary
She'll chase us though the dark
Activate our nerve endings
If we stay
